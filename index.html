							<p>Now more than ever are engineers expected to uphold the <strong>honour, integrity, and interests</strong> 
								of the engineering profession in all facets of their work. Effective engineering practice requires competency of 
								several CEAB attributes, including <strong>impact of engineering on the environment and society</strong>, and <strong>professionalism.</strong></p>
							<li><strong>Impact of engineering on society and the environment</strong> is defined as the ability to steward the 
								application of science and technology to address the environmental and social challenges of our time.
								As drivers of change, engineers have the obligation to consider the long-term impact of their actions and their effect on society, and steer these
								changes in a positive direction through sustainable design and environmental stewardship.
							</li>
							<br/>
							<li><strong>Professionalism</strong> is defined as a particular set of values and workplace behavior. In effective engineering practice, professional behavior 
								impacts the entire team, affecting every aspect of day-to-day operations and ultimately impacting the quality of work produced. 
								Unprofessional behavior in the workplace affects the morale of the team as a whole.

							</li>
							<br/>
							<p>These attributes will have significant impacts on my engineering practcies during my PEY with SAFRAN Hyperloop and my long-term goals of pursing graduate studies.
								Working for a global company on a real project demands that I show respect to my co-workers and demonstrate mature responsibility. Pursuing graduate studies
								requires me to preserve through challenges and acknowledge appropriate feedback from supervisors. For both of these goals, I will need to
								consider the impact of my actions on the health and safety of others and on the environment to ensure long-term success.
							</p>
							<p>This porfolio is intended to demonstrate my competency in addressing environmental considerations and professionalism across teams for an audience of future employers and academic supervisors.

							<h2>IMPACT OF ENGINEERING ON SOCIETY AND THE environment</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>As part of MIE315, Design for the Environment (DfE), students produce a primary consultant’s report (PCR) as part of a course project. 
								The PCR details the team’s analysis of Functions Objectives and Constraints (FOC) and a Streamlined Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) of two product alternatives. 
								Our team was tasked with selecting either aluminum or composites for use in a car’s engine and body. I was responsible for selecting the objectives for the FOC 
								analysis. In MIE315, we learned that one issue of DfE was the societal impacts of a product during its life-cycle, including the wellbeing of those assembling technology.
								 When selecting the objectives, I proposed a “manufacturing safety” objective that scored each alternative based on their “Hazardous Materials Identification System” score, which is used 
								to evaluate if any particular situation or item may have the potential to cause harm. <br/><br/>

								This objective allowed our team to analyze and evaluate the health and safety risks associated with each alternative. I'm glad to have had this experience as I will have to consider the 
								health and safety of individuals who will interact with the Hyperloop technology I will design during my PEY. Moving forward, I hope to continue to explore the interaction of engineering
								and the health and safety of society through all life-cycle stages.

						<h2>Communication</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p>As part of MIE315, Design for the Environment, students completed feedback after each report submission. 
							Our team used the Teamwork Effectiveness Learning System (TELS) to give anonymous, constructive feedback 
							to our teammates and learn how to improve ourselves for future work sessions. After the PCR, I received a 
							significant amount of feedback on my behaviour during work sessions. Much of it was related to how I had joined 
							meetings while still being involved in a game, or how I would be distracted by other conversations. Part of being 
							a professional is having respect for others and their time: I will need to remove myself from these distractions to become a better teammate.
						</p>

									<h3>Communication</h3>
									<p>TELS allows the team to reflect on our team's teamwork, and provide constructive feedback to improve our team's performance during the remainder of the course. 
										The feedback revealed that I need to improve my attentiveness during worksessions to become a professional engineer.</p>
